# Overview

For this project, I wanted to create a text based adventure in the language of Java. I created a story that is simple but could be expounded upon with more options and richer story to tell. Here's a description of the project:

"Chronicles of Eldoria" is a text-based role-playing game written in Java that invites players to embark on a mystical adventure in the enchanting realm of Eldoria. Set against a backdrop of magic, danger, and the impending threat of darkness, players take on the role of a young adventurer with the noble quest of retrieving the legendary Crystal of Lumina to save their village.

I wanted to see what Java can do for game creation and see what I knew and what I could do with the langauge. This is something i hope to improve upon or use what I've learned to create better project!
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used an IDE called VSCode for coding and testing, incorporating tools like the Scanner class for user input and Thread.sleep() for atmospheric pauses that i hoped would slow down the pace of the game for the user.

- More options for the user to have
- Create a more in-depth story
- Maybe expand this idea into other projects or areas
